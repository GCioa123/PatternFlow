# VQVAE Model based Generator 

## Problem & Algorithm Description

## VQ-VAE Model Description and Suitability

## Dependencies

## Example Outputs
* (Average) SSIM score:
* Reconstructed images/predicted images.
* Discrete visualisation




## Training and testing data split justification
* The sourced OASIS dataset had already divided its images into training, validation and testing sets (segmented and not segmented). The segmented training set was used to train the model and the segmented validation set was used to test the model.
